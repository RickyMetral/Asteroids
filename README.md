# Asteroids!

This is my recreation of the old arcade game Asteroids using Python. This project was built using the Pygame module and is a simple, fun side project of mine. 

The game itself has been turned into a ```.exe``` file within ```dist``` using the pyinstaller module. All code is available to inspect in ```src```. I plan on making small updates and improvements to the game in the future so keep an eye out!

Currently the game only runs on Windows machines. All sounds in the game were downloaded from https://classicgaming.cc/classics/asteroids/sounds and the ship explosion png's were retrieved from https://www.pngitem.com/download/hwmJTxJ_pixel-effect-png-asteroid-explosion-sprite-transparent-png/. All other assets were created by me :). 

To run the game simply fork the repo and run ```Asteroids.exe``` within ```dist``` and your all set. Enjoy!
